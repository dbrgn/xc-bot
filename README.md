# XC Bot

[![CircleCI][circle-ci-badge]][circle-ci]

A chat bot that notifies you about new paragliding cross-country flights
published on [XContest](https://www.xcontest.org/) as part of the Swiss [Cross
Country Cup](https://www.xcontest.org/switzerland/de/). Inspired by the
Telegram bot [XC Switzerland](https://telegram.me/XC_Swiss_Bot) by Sergey Popov.

## Architecture

The bot is written in Rust using a SQLite database for keeping track of the
processed flights and flight subscriptions.

## Docker Image

The repository includes a Dockerfile.

Important paths:

- `/etc/xc-bot/config.toml`: Configuration file
- `/xc-bot/`: Work directory (including database)

You'll probably want to mount both files into the container.

Note: This container runs as default user by default. If you use podman, you
can run the container as non-root.
